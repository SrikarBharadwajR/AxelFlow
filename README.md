# AxelFlow

AxelFlow is a highly versatile serial bus servo driver designed for seamless integration with any microcontroller-based development platform. With AxelFlow, developers can control multiple servo motors efficiently through a single bus, making it an ideal solution for robotics, automation, and embedded systems projects.

## Features

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Designed to work with any microcontroller, from Arduino to STM32, ESP32, and more.
- **Serial Bus Communication**: Utilizes a serial bus (Half-Duplex UART) for simple and scalable communication between multiple servo motors.
- **Efficient Motor Control**: Provides precise control of servo motors with configurable speed, position, and torque settings.
- **Flexible Interface**: Supports both hardware and software UART implementations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To get started with AxelFlow, youâ€™ll need:
- A microcontroller (e.g., STM32, Arduino, ESP32)
- Servos compatible with the serial bus interface
- UART communication interface (hardware or software)
